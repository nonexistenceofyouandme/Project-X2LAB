# Project-X2LAB
The project is about developing the fastest line tracing robot in Thailand

We have planned to use coreless motor as a main drive because of its high RPM

Adding downforce for enchancing tire's grip by using 3D-printed impeller.

## ðŸŒ€ Theory of Enhancing Tire Grip

The impeller sucks the air out from beneath the robot, creating a region of very low pressure.  
As a result, the higher pressure above the robot pushes it downward toward the ground.

The force that makes the robot move forward is the reaction pair of the frictional force.  
Friction can be calculated using:

$$
F = \mu N
$$

where:

-  Î¼ = coefficient of friction  
-  N = mg + pressure difference

When the normal force \( N \) increases, the frictional force also increases.  
Therefore, the robot gains more grip, allowing it to accelerate, brake, and turn more effectively.
